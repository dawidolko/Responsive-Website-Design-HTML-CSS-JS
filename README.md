The home page looks good in the desktop version, there are no bends or protruding edges anywhere. The navigation bar looks clear, is described and additionally stimulates the imagination through icons.

<br>![project](img/description/photo24.png)

The gallery and details section is quite transparent in the desktop version, you can see equal spacing from the edges and equal spacing between photos. Everything looks legible and is easy to read.

<br>![project](img/description/photo25.png)

The slider and product sections have equal indentations and good arrangement, are fully legible and meet the requirements regarding the assumptions.

<br>![project](img/description/photo26.png)
<br>![project](img/description/photo27.png)

The elements are adjusted in such a way that they do not irritate the eyes and encourage people to click on a given product. Certainly their number is not overwhelming and it naturally stimulates the imagination.

<br>![project](img/description/photo28.png)
<br>![project](img/description/photo29.png)

The website ends with a footer section which, in a minimalist way, does not spoil the overall design of the website and fully adapts to selected devices.

<br>![project](img/description/photo30.png)

The subpages are also correctly arranged and readable, realizing the vision of a comprehensive company.

<br>![project](img/description/photo31.png)

Contact and payment forms are placed centrally in the middle of the screen, which is certainly pleasing to the eye and suitable for the user.

<br>![project](img/description/photo32.png)
<br>![project](img/description/photo33.png)

The products and their descriptions are matched to each other, which shows that they fit together and do not spoil the vision of combining the whole.

## Website tests in the "Mobile" format:

<br>![project](img/description/photo34.png)

The navigation bar looks good, the basket icon is separate to stand out from all the tabs. The logo is constantly placed in the corner of the screen to make it stick in your mind. It stands out and does not overlap with other elements.

<br>![project](img/description/photo35.png)

<br>![project](img/description/photo36.png)

As you can see, the photos have changed their position and are still evenly spaced from each other, which meets the vision of a responsive website.

<br>![project](img/description/photo37.png)

The slider is now ready to scroll slide by slide, so you can still view the products presented in it in a clear way.

<br>![project](img/description/photo38.png)

The promotion, newsletter and footer bar are also arranged in a clear and responsive way. This shows that the website is fully responsive and well-adjusted.

<br>![project](img/description/photo39.png)

As you can see, the subpages are also fully responsive and meet the project assumptions. The spacing is even, which makes the website visually pleasing and attracts customers. The navigation bar does not cover too large a field and meets the assumption of a touch field (40px x 40px).

<br>![project](img/description/photo40.png)

Contact and payment forms are perfectly adapted to mobile devices, they are also legible and meet the requirements of a responsive website.

To sum up, it can be noted that the website in both mobile and desktop versions is well-made. There are no indentations, edge cutting or scrolling strips anywhere. The website meets the assumptions and has been fully responsively tested. Below you will find additional tests such as validation results and page loading speed tests.

## Performance testing:

### Charging Time:

- Using tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse to analyze page loading time and identify elements that may slow it down.

### Resource Optimization:

- Check whether images, scripts and stylesheets are optimized for fast loading (e.g. compression, minification).

## Browser compatibility testing:

### Desktop Browsers:

- Testing the website on the latest versions of popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure that the appearance and functions work consistently.

### Mobile Browsers:

- Checking the operation of the website on mobile browsers, especially on Android and iOS systems.

## Accessibility testing:

### Accessibility Standards:

- Using tools such as WAVE or AX to check whether the page is accessible to limited users, such as those using screen readers.

### Contrast and Readability:

- Assessment of whether the contrast of the text against the background is sufficient for people with visual impairments, and whether the fonts and their sizes are legible.

## Summary:

The website has been checked according to the above standards, no errors were found that would result from incorrect code writing or lack of specification of any of its components. The website is responsive for each tab in the same way, all its functions work and fulfill their function. The website works correctly regardless of browsers and has high results in various tests.

According to the documentation, the website was subjected to rigorous tests of functionality, responsiveness, performance, browser compatibility and accessibility, which yielded very good results. Both the HTML and CSS pages were validated without errors, which proves the high quality of the code and its compliance with standards. The website is optimally responsive on various devices and its functions work flawlessly. Thanks to the tests and validations carried out, the website received high scores in the Lighthouse tool, including maximum efficiency of 100/100, which proves that the loading speed has been optimized. The accessibility of the website was also positively assessed, although room for improvement was indicated for even better accessibility for people with disabilities. These results confirm that the website is error-free and meets its objectives, providing users with a functional, responsive and professionally crafted experience.

### Lighthouse results:

- Performance: The screenshot shows a score of 100/100, which means the site is highly optimized for loading speed. This result is the result of good programming practices, such as image and script optimization, which translates into short loading times and a positive user experience.

## 5. Code comments and documentation KSS and jsDoc

The code is commented in a way that is intended to provide clear and readable information about each section of the code. Comments are used to describe what each block of code does and what its main purposes and functions are. This helps developers understand the structure and operation of the code and facilitates maintenance and possible modifications in the future.

Comments are also used to fulfill the requirement of this section:

- Comments are used to describe root variables, keyframes, and styles for the page body, header, and other sections of the code.
- Comments are written in a clear and understandable way, which helps other developers quickly understand the code.
- Comments contain information about what a given fragment of code does, what its visual effects are and what techniques (e.g. flexbox) are used in the project.

Thanks to this approach, the code is readable and easy to manage, and developers can seamlessly work on the project and make any changes or improvements.

All photos used in the project were generated using DALL-E artificial intelligence. I am unable to provide direct links to sources because these images are the result of the DALL-E model generation process and do not come from specific external sources.

In the part of the documentation devoted to the source code, special attention was paid to detailed documentation of the most important CSS functions. The documentation was prepared using the KSS (Knyle Style Sheets) methodology, which allowed for the creation of clear, consistent and easily accessible documentation for all team members. This methodology allows both the description of styles directly in the code and the automatic generation of style guides, which significantly facilitates CSS code management and its subsequent maintenance. KSS documentation for the most important CSS functions covers not only the selectors and properties themselves, but also their use, possible modifications and examples of use, which makes it much easier for other developers to understand and use the code.

<br>![project](img/description/photo43.png)

The entire documentation is also available at the link [here](https://projekt2.dawidolko.pl/kss/styleguide/).

The JavaScript used in the project is documented using JSDoc, a standard for JavaScript comments that allows you to generate attractive and functional documentation. This includes:

- Function and Method Descriptions: Clear explanations of what each function or method does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.
- Usage Examples: Tips on how to use individual functions and methods in practice.
- Typing: Information about expected data types, which is especially helpful in a dynamic JavaScript environment.

Thanks to these methods, documentation becomes an integral part of the project, supporting its transparency, maintenance and further development. The code is friendly to programmers of all skill levels and enables effective project management.

<br>![project](img/description/photo44.png)
<br>![project](img/description/photo45.png)

The entire documentation is also available at the link here: [link](https://projekt2.dawidolko.pl/jsDoc1/out/index.html)

### AI graphics:

All graphics used in the project are generated using DALL-E, a modern AI tool for generating images. These images are unique and tailored to the visual needs of the project, which adds individual character and innovation to the website's presentation.

To sum up, code documentation, along with systematic commenting, the use of KSS and JSDoc, and unique AI graphics, create a solid and accessible foundation for the project. Everything works properly and efficiently, ensuring high quality and ease of further development and adaptation of the project.
